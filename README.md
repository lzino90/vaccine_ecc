Code for the following papers:

1) "Modelling the Effect of Vaccination and Human Behaviour on the Spread of Epidemic Diseases on Temporal Networks" by Kathinka Frieswijk, Lorenzo Zino, and Ming Cao, published in the Proceedings of the 2022 European Control Conference (available at: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2111.05590)
2) "A Polarized Temporal Network Model to Study the Spread of Recurrent Epidemic Diseases in a Partially Vaccinated Population" by Kathinka Frieswijk, Lorenzo Zino, and Ming Cao, published in the IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering (available at https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSE.2023.3272472)

INSTRUCTIONS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: 

The code for the simulation is written in MATLAB, using version 2021a and requires no add-ons. All the functions needed are included in the corresponding folders. Hence, to run the code it is sufficient to open the corresponding folder with MATLAB.

The code has been tested on a PC with 16GB RAM and CPU 1.9 GHz with OS Windows 10 (64-bit). Maximum run time is approximately 10 seconds, for a population of n=10,000 individuals.

ORGANIZATION:

The folder ECC contains the files for paper 1). The folder JOURNAL contains the files for paper 2). In both folders, the file "FIG#.m" generates Figure # of the paper.
